# CO₂ Emissions Analysis System – Algorithms & Data Structures Project
This repository has been created to store my work on the individaul project assigned to our class in Algorithms and Data structures.

It was a fun project conducting research on how to perform certain things such as creation of heaps data structures and fighting for my life to convert a pandas series to an appropriate data structure so I could solve **Q4**😂 

To access the main file please click [here](IndivC.py).

Thank you for taking the time to look over my code,🙇‍♂️. Comments on what I could improve on are highly appreciated😁
